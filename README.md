# IntelliVault

This is the best [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)-[Plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) ever. Why? Actually [IDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Know), but...

This plugin allows you to use [ChatGPT](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) inside of your excellent vault to make it more ✨excellent✨.

You only need a paid [OpanAI-API Token](https://platform.openai.com/) and this would work. XD 

## MKADb (orig. [МКАД](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Ring_Road)б)

MKADb (aka. Mutli-Keyword Assiative Database, aka. Mega Keyword Awesome Database, aka. есть ли жизнь за МКАДом?) 

Is best database ever, which allows you to store notes by keywords.

This db is written in rust, what makes it so ⚡️ blazing fast 🚀
