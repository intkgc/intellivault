# IntelliVault.

This is the best [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)-[Plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) ever. Why? Actually [IDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Know), but...

This plugin allows you to use [ChatGPT](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) inside of your excellent vault to make it more ✨excellent✨.

You only need a paid [OpanAI-API Token](https://platform.openai.com/) and this would work. XD.

# Features.

## ChatGPT in Obsidian.

IntelliVault integrates ChatGPT directly into your vault. Now you can easily interact with ChatGPT inside your notes to analyze and generate content on the fly. Whether you need to summarize a note, brainstorm ideas, or get assistance with your writing, it’s all just a few clicks away.


## MKADb (orig. [МКАД](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Ring_Road)б) - The Best Database Ever.

MKADb (aka. Multi-Keyword Associative Database, aka. Mega Keyword Awesome Database, aka. есть ли жизнь за МКАДом?) is a ⚡️ blazing fast 🚀🧬🚞🌪️, rust-powered database designed to store and retrieve notes by keywords. It’s the fastest database you’ll ever use for managing your notes.

~~Currently, IntelliVault includes MKADb to help organize your notes efficiently and make your vault even more intelligent.~~

# Upcoming Features.

- [ ] Analysis Feature: We’re working on an analysis feature that will help you further process and gain insights from your notes, all powered by ChatGPT.
- [ ] Cross-Platform Compatibility: We’re switching from SQLite to our own self-written database, making IntelliVault compatible across multiple platforms.
